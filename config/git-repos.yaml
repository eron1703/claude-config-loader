# === PORT CONFLICT NOTES ===
port_conflicts:
  "8529": "arangodb - shared by commander, flowmaster, resolver, documentation (need coordination)"
  "3000": "frontend - used by commander, flowmaster (port 3000 externally maps to 5173 in flowmaster)"
  "3010": "frontend - conflict between engage and sdx"
  "5432": "postgres - used by documentation/flowmaster (5432), engage (5432)"

# Organization
organizations:
  personal:
    platform: github
    url: https://github.com/eron1703
    access: "Personal access token in ~/.gitconfig"

  hcb_consulting:
    platform: github
    url: https://github.com/HCB-Consulting-ME
    access: "Organization member access"
    projects:
      - commander (flow-commander)
      - flowmaster (ea-mcp)
      - dxg
      - sdx

# Access Patterns
access:
  github_ssh: |
    # SSH keys configured in ~/.ssh/config
    # Host github.com
    #   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    #   User git

  github_https: |
    # Personal access token stored in git credential helper
    # git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

# Workflow
workflow:
  branching: "Feature branches from main"
  commits: "Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)"
  prs: "Required for all changes, squash and merge"
  ci: "See cicd.yaml for pipeline configuration"

# Dependencies Graph
dependency_notes: |
  Database sharing:
  - resolver + flowmaster share ArangoDB pattern (different instances)
  - sdx uses both flowmaster and resolver ArangoDB instances
  - engage connects to demo server ArangoDB
  - commander has own ArangoDB instance

  Service integration:
  - engage uses dxg API via host.docker.internal:8005
  - flowmaster has internal services calling each other
  - employee-app calls flowmaster backend
