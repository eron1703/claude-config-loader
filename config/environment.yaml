# Development Environment Configuration
#
# Information about the development machine and setup

# Folder Structure
workspace:
  root: ~/projects/
  description: "All development projects are in ~/projects/"
  projects:
    - resolver
    - flowmaster
    - claude-config-loader
    - test-rig
  notes: "Create new projects as subdirectories of ~/projects/"

# Containerization
docker:
  platform: orbstack
  notes: |
    - Using OrbStack (not Docker Desktop)
    - NEVER shut down Docker/OrbStack service globally
    - NEVER use: docker system prune -a
    - NEVER use: orbstack stop (stops entire service)
    - Multiple users/agents use this machine in parallel
    - Only manage individual containers, not the service

  safe_commands:
    - "docker-compose up/down"
    - "docker stop <container>"
    - "docker rm <container>"
    - "docker-compose restart <service>"

  dangerous_commands:
    - "orbstack stop (NEVER USE)"
    - "docker system prune -a (NEVER USE)"
    - "killall Docker (NEVER USE)"
    - "systemctl stop docker (NEVER USE)"

# Port Management
ports:
  strategy: "Use non-standard ports consistently"
  ranges:
    backend: "9000-9099"
    frontend: "3000-3099"
    databases: "5432, 8529, 27017"
  notes: "Always check port availability before use: lsof -i :PORT"

# Multi-User Environment
environment_type: "multi-user/multi-agent"
notes: |
  - Multiple supervisor agents work in parallel
  - Multiple human users may be active
  - Don't interfere with other users' containers
  - Stick to assigned ports
  - Don't change global configurations
