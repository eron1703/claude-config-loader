# === PORT ALLOCATION GUIDELINES ===

guidelines:
  - "Always check port availability before use: lsof -i :PORT"
  - "Use consistent ports across restarts for same project"
  - "Document new ports immediately in this file"
  - "Prefer non-standard ports (avoid 80, 443, 8080, 3000 for new projects)"
  - "Check for conflicts before starting containers"
  - "Use Docker networks for isolation when running multiple projects"
