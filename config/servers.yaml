    notes: |
      - All development happens locally via Docker/OrbStack
      - Multiple users/agents work in parallel
      - NEVER shut down OrbStack service globally
      - Only manage individual containers

      - Configured in ~/.ssh/config with two access methods
      - ben user: ssh demo-server (key: ~/.ssh/ben_demo)
      - root user: ssh demo-server-root (key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_demo)
      - CI/CD deploy key in GitLab (gitlab-ci-deploy)
      - engage project connects to ArangoDB on this server
      - SDX MCP Server connects to same ArangoDB instance (sdx database)
      - Full K3S Kubernetes cluster with monitoring stack
      - Used for demos and staging deployments
      - Comprehensive documentation saved to ~/projects/plane-mcp-server/
