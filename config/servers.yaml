# Server and Infrastructure Information
#
# Document all servers, VMs, and infrastructure resources

servers:
  # Example structure - customize for your environment
  # production_api:
  #   host: api.example.com
  #   ip: 192.168.1.100
  #   purpose: "Production API server"
  #   access: "SSH via bastion"
  #   credentials: "See 1Password: Production Servers"
  #
  # staging_api:
  #   host: staging-api.example.com
  #   ip: 192.168.1.101
  #   purpose: "Staging environment"
  #   access: "Direct SSH"
  #   credentials: "See 1Password: Staging"

  localhost:
    host: localhost
    ip: 127.0.0.1
    purpose: "Local development environment"
    access: "Direct"
    platform: "macOS with OrbStack"
    docker: "OrbStack (NOT Docker Desktop)"
    workspace: "~/projects/"
    notes: |
      - All development happens locally via Docker/OrbStack
      - Multiple users/agents work in parallel
      - NEVER shut down OrbStack service globally
      - Only manage individual containers

  demo-server:
    host: demo-server
    ip: 65.21.153.235
    purpose: "Demo/staging server for testing and demos"
    access: "SSH (see connection details below)"
    platform: "Linux"
    services:
      - arangodb:8529 (used by engage project)
    connection:
      user_ben:
        host: demo-server
        hostname: 65.21.153.235
        user: ben
        port: 22
        identity_file: ~/.ssh/ben_demo
        connect: "ssh demo-server"
      user_root:
        host: demo-server-root
        hostname: 65.21.153.235
        user: root
        port: 22
        identity_file: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_demo
        connect: "ssh demo-server-root"
    notes: |
      - Configured in ~/.ssh/config with two access methods
      - ben user: ssh demo-server (key: ~/.ssh/ben_demo)
      - root user: ssh demo-server-root (key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_demo)
      - engage project connects to ArangoDB on this server
      - Used for demos and staging deployments

# Cloud Resources
cloud:
  # aws:
  #   account_id: "123456789012"
  #   region: us-east-1
  #   resources:
  #     - EC2 instances
  #     - RDS databases
  #     - S3 buckets
  #   credentials: "AWS CLI configured with profile 'default'"

# Access Patterns
access:
  # bastion:
  #   host: bastion.example.com
  #   purpose: "Jump host for production access"
  #   credentials: "SSH key in ~/.ssh/bastion_key"

# Notes
notes:
  - "Never store passwords in this file"
  - "Use references to password managers (1Password, LastPass, etc.)"
  - "Update this file when infrastructure changes"
